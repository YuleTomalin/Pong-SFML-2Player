# Pong-SFML-2Player
Replica(ish) of the 2-player Pong game using the SFML Library and C++.

Needed stuff for this project:
1. SFML Library using vcpkg
2. Latest Version of Visual Studio (Doesn't really matter, but I used VS 2022 for this project)
3. Understanding of C++

Still WIP and may or may not be updated sooner or later. 
You can copy and/or add code for yourself, I don't really mind.
I don't accept commits and stuff, this is basically for reference only.
